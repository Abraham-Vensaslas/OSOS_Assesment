The total sequestration reported here differs from that reported by Braun and Bremer (2019), because they reported mean rather than total SOC sequestration rate across depths. 2. Campbell et al., (2014) reported 0-5 cm depth with a linear fit, and did not report the non-linear relationships for deeper interals. We fit 3rd order polynomials to all intervals. 3. Authors used linear regression in Huyler et al., 2014 and localized polynomial fitting in Huyler et al., 2017. We applied the most parsimonious polynomial regressions to each depth interval, which were a linear, 2nd order, and third order polynomial to the top, mid, and bottom interval, respectively. 4. Raciti et al., (2011) applied a linear regression to the whole profile, but the 10-30, 30-70, and 70-100 cm intervals had non-linear trends. We fit these intervals with 3rd order polynomials, and fit a linear regression to the whole profile. 5. Seasonality for these cities is based on findings by Trammell et al. (2019, https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.1884). Contrary to expectation based on climate, they showed C3 species dominated lawns in Los Angeles, CA.\\n\\n\\n\\nCitation List\\n\\nAcuña E., A.

The first method is using an installation multiplier to derive the total installed cost based on the material price. The labor multipliers are separated out by “scenario” (new construction or retrofit). Retrofit scenarios include costs for removal or other demolition of existing components. After getting the estimated material price from calculating the material price regression using the coefficients, intercepts, and chosen performance metric input values, the multiplier is used to calculate the total installed cost or cost per square foot.

Improving instrument sensitivity \\nis likely to reduce sample size requirements and increase temporal resolution from analyses of \\naccretionary tissues. gains in instrument sensitivity will be particularly helpful when applied to the \\nanalysis of individual compounds. Finally, we need improved networking to enhance the dissemina-\\ntion and exchange of data among ecogeochemists. This will require increased collaboration among \\ngeochemists, ecologists, geostatisticians and software developers, as well as the establishment of \\neasily accessible public databases.\\nAcknowledgements\\nwe were supported by funding from the National Science Foundation (Division of Ocean Sciences,'),\n",
